CLI, or Command Line Interface is an interface that lets users write commands that affect the terminal within lines of code. It utilizes your computer keyboard as the only thing being used within your work, rather than choosing options from a menu of what you want the code to say. The commands within this interface essentially use commands to create a file that lets people interact directly with their operating system (OS). A GUI, on the other hand, is a Graphical User Interface where the layout is much more user friendly. Users are able to use different buttons to interact with their OS to make things easier, especially for beginners. The main differences between these two is ease versus quality. A GUI is largely easier to use, especially with its user interface being built around the use of scroll wheels and buttons which you click with your mouse. It is much easier to learn as well. However, a CLI, once learned, is much more efficient to work with, takes less digital memory to use, and can deliver much more precision within a user's work. A better option for beginners would probably be a GUI, but to make very well rounded code a CLI may be the better option, where it is impossible to prioritize ease of work with pre-written menus.
