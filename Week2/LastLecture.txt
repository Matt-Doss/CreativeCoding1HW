In The Last Lecture interview what affected me the most was his perseverance and flexibility. To make the trip he really wanted to go on, he kind of bent the rules. He resigned as faculty and gained a press pass because that is how he would be able to go on the trip. All of this work led to him innovating and changing the world. With his work in AI and world building he was able to produce new technologies that changed the world.
        I didn’t particularly connect with any of his messages but his persistence stuck more with me. It was more how he acted that stuck. A lot of the story he was talking about failing and trying again and that was very helpful because I feel like with work, in school and at work it is very easy to mess up especially since I work as a cook and can’t constantly make things perfectly. I guess it kind of just shows me it is a learning opportunity.
