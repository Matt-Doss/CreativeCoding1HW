In response to the article on learning styles, I would say that they do kind of matter a little more than it is given credit for. I can see how the evidence points to them not really affecting how we learn, but in my personal experience, if I use my preferred learning style I am much more likely to enjoy learning, which makes me feel like I care a lot more.
